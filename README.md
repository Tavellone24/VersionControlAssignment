Version Control is a feature used in Github & similar project systems to allow previous versions, or atleast the changes of those version, of a project to be accessed and brought into current versions. Version Control is used to make large scale collaboration more seamless.
Git is the medium which interfaces with Github, in the same way your car gets you to work, Git is the means to get your project onto Github (can put your project on other project hosting services that support Git)
Git clone: Basically it tells the computer to download something.
Git Status: Git looks in the folder it was initialized in and tells you whats in there that isnt the same as the main branch, and whether its been added or not.
Git Add: Adds whatever you specify to the repository.
Git commit -m "": commits whatever you have added to a single node, sort of like putting new parts in a box then closing the box. Within the quotations is the attached note to that commit, sort of like putting a label on a box to say whats inside, except nodes can replace or remove features from the project.
Git Push: ships out that committed node to the repository, enabling it to be accessed on Github!
